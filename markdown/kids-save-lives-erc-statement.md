# Hands that help – Training children is training for life

## Slide 1: Some data ...

- sudden OHCA with unsuccessful CPR : third leading cause of death in industrialised nations
- after OHCA : survival rate is 2-10%
- in Europe and US together : 700.000 people die / year 
- EMS response time : 6-12 minutes
- following cardiac arrest : brain starts to die after only 3-5 min

## Slide 2: The role of bystanders 

- 70% of OHCA : witnessed by family members, friends and other bystanders $\rightarrow$ *laypeople*
- lethal gap on time before EMS : can be bridged by these people
- first minutes after OHCA : still oxygen in the blood and lungs, chest compressions can save hundreds of thousands of lives each year
- CPR by bystanders increases *chances of survival* 2-4 times

## Slide 3: The role of mandatory education in school

- highest bystander rates : Scandinavian countries
- reason : education of school children in CPR has been mandatory for decades

## Slide 4: Organisations that are involved

- World Health Organization (WHO)
- European Resuscitation Council (ERC)
- European Patient Safety Foundation (EPSF)
- International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR)
- World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists (WFSA)

##  Slide 5: Main recommendations

- two hours of CPR training annually from the age of 12 years in all schools
- children are more responsive to instructions at that age
- they learn more easily to help others at that age
- starting at young age children will not forget how to save a life
- healthcare professionals, teachers trained to teach CPR, school children : all can serve as *multipliers*
- CPR knowledge and skills : children can teach family and friends
- through education 300.000 additional lives /year can be saved

## Slide 6: 10 ERC principles

1. Everyone can save a life – even children can save a life
2. Up to two hours of CPR training a year for school children is enough
3. Training must involve hands-on practice which may be aug-
mented with theoretical - including virtual - learning. Such
training has also been performed without sophisticated equip-
ment or speciﬁc resuscitation manikins.
4. Annual training of school children should start by the age of 12 years or earlier
5. Trained children should be encouraged to train other people. The homework for all children after such training should be: please train 10 other people within the next two weeks and report
6. A wide range of people, including anaesthesiologists, cardiologists, emergency physicians, nurses, paramedics, medical and other healthcare students, trained teachers and many other volunteers can successfully teach school children in CPR - in schools, in hospitals and elsewhere
7. Every National Resuscitation Council (NRC) or similar organisation should support the implementation of a national initiative and “Kids Save Lives” campaign in its country
8. With “Kids Save Lives”, children will also learn relevant social responsibility and social skills
9. National programmes that train school children in CPR can save more lives, improve productivity of society, and reduce healthcare costs
