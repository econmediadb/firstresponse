# All citizens of the world can save a life

## Raising cardiac arrest awareness

1. Check
   - Make sure it is safe to approach
   - Check for any response from the victim
   - Tilt the head back, lift the chin and check breathing
   - If breathing is absent or not normal, CPR is needed

2. Call
   - Call 112 and follow their instructions
   - If someone is there to help, ask them to call 112 for you, and let them fetch an AED    
   - Cardiac compressions are most important for survival
   - Do not delay or interrupt cardiac compressions

3. Compress
   - Place both hands in the centre of the chest
   - Compress the chest 5 to 6 cm 100-120 times / min to the rhythm of "Stayin' Alive"   
   - If you learned how to do it, provide 2 rescue breaths between every 30 compressions, otherwise pump the chest continuously
   - Push hard and fast. Donâ€™t worry, you can't do any harm
   - If an AED arrives, switch it on immediately and follow the instructions
   - Once the emergency services arrive, continue until you are told to stop
   - Well done! Doing something saves lives and is ALWAYS better than doing nothing
