# First Response to Cardiac Arrest

<em>Es ist nicht genug zu wissen, man muß auch anwenden; es ist nicht genug zu wollen, man muß auch tun.</em> Goethe

## Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival

- educate and train the public in CPR
- effective treatments for specific types of cardiac arrest are widely available and could reduce deaths and disability if they were more efficiently implemented
- wide diversity in survival rates in communities : In some communities more than 60 percent of persons with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (due to bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation) survive and are discharged from the hospital. In far more communities, the survival rate is 10 percent or less.
- challenges and barriers to successfully treat cardiac arrest
- primary goal: provide high-quality care quickly
  1. recognize the event by the public (bystanders, who are at the forefront of the response and have the opportunity to report the event and initiate the response)
  2. call emergency (112 in Luxembourg)
  3. follow guidance to the rescuer (from emergency telecommunicator)
  4. provide a defibrillatory shock (if required)
  5. achieve airway control
- cardiac arrest chain of survival ([illustration](https://www.aed.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/chain-of-survival.png))
- unifying framework for improving patient outcomes from cardiac arrest ( [illustartion](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/openbook/23695/xhtml/images/img-18-1.jpg) )
- establish a <em>national cardiac arrest registry</em> ( [data for Luxembourg](https://112.public.lu/dam-assets/fr/publications/rapports/ohca/ohca-rapport-annuel-2021-english-v30-clean.pdf) )
