# First Response to Cardiac Arrest

<em>Es ist nicht genug zu wissen, man muß auch anwenden; es ist nicht genug zu wollen, man muß auch tun.</em> Goethe

## Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival

- educate and train the public in CPR
- effective treatments for specific types of cardiac arrest are widely available and could reduce deaths and disability if they were more efficiently implemented
- wide diversity in survival rates in communities : In some communities more than 60 percent of persons with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (due to bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation) survive and are discharged from the hospital. In far more communities, the survival rate is 10 percent or less.
- challenges and barriers to successfully treat cardiac arrest
- primary goal: provide high-quality care quickly
  1. recognize the event by the public (bystanders, who are at the forefront of the response and have the opportunity to report the event and initiate the response)
  2. call emergency (112 in Luxembourg)
  3. follow guidance to the rescuer (from emergency telecommunicator)
  4. provide a defibrillatory shock (if required)
  5. achieve airway control

- unifying framework for improving patient outcomes from cardiac arrest ( [illustration](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/openbook/23695/xhtml/images/img-18-1.jpg) )
- establish a <em>national cardiac arrest registry</em> ( [data for Luxembourg](https://112.public.lu/dam-assets/fr/publications/rapports/ohca/ohca-rapport-annuel-2021-english-v30-clean.pdf) ) 
- improved patient outcomes are more likely when the different actors in the society collaborate and coordinate their activities:
  1. comprehensive surveillance and reporting
  2. community engagement
  3. new treatments and treatment paradigms
  4. training and education
  5. local translation of research into practice
  6. continuous quality improvement
-  Defining <em>cardiac arrest</em> : Cardiac arrest is a severe malfunction or cessation of the electrical and mechanical activity of the heart. Under normal circumstances, the sinoatrial node initiates and sends an electrical signal to the right and left atria, causing the atria to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The electrical signal then travels from the atrioventricular node to the right and left ventricles, causing them to contract in a coordinated sequence and pump blood out of the heart to the lungs and the rest of the body. When the signal dissipates, the ventricles relax, and the process begins again after a normal delay. Although the terms are often used interchangeably in the media and casual conversation, cardiac arrest is different and medically distinct from a heart attack (i.e., a myocardial infarction). Compare this to a heart attack, a condition in which blood flow to an area of the heart is blocked by a narrowed or completely obstructed coronary artery. This causes inadequate oxygenation and subsequent injury or death to a portion of the heart. [video that explains the difference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPKLq-LQjbc)
-  The symptoms of a **cardiac arrest** are : 
  1. instantanous loss of consciousness and collapse
  2. absent or abnormal breathing (e.g., gasping or agonal breaths)
- The symptoms of a **heart attack** are :
  1. chest pain
  2. shortness of breath
  3. sweatiness
  4. dizziness
- a heart attack can cause cardiac arrest

## First Aid

### ABCs of First Aid 

- **Airway**: If someone’s not breathing, the first thing you need to do is open their airway.
- **Breathing**: If you have cleared a person’s airway but they’re still not breathing, provide rescue breathing.
- **Circulation**: As you are doing rescue breathing, perform chest compressions to keep the person’s blood circulating. If the person is not responsive, check their pulse. If their heart has stopped, provide chest compressions.
- **Disability** assessment, deadly bleeding, or automated external defibrillator (AED). An AED is a device that shocks the heart to make it start beating again.
- **Examination** (checking the person for signs of injury, bleeding, allergies, or other problems once you know they’re breathing and their heart is beating).
